# Enigma ES6

This is an Enigma machine implementation in ES6. I built several tests with
Jasmine 2 to prove it works. It tests some getters, setters, samples from
Wikipedia but nothing fancy.

It contains also an implementation of the Enigma M4, with the fourth rotor and
the thin reflector, but it lacks of constraints and the terminology is not
accurate, as 4th rotor and thin reflector swap pin and plate sides.

Also, although the fourth rotor cannot advance automatically the method accepts
even that rotor.

Yes, it needs validation.
